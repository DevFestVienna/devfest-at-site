  title: "Coding should be fun"
  description: "As coders we are likely to find ourselves in a world of changing requirements and pressure to get things done. This sadly often leads us to cut corners on code quality and to implement quick and dirty solutions. Decisions like these do not help in the long run. They increase the cost of upcoming changes and decrease our joy at work.<br>I will show you how refactoring helps rescuing your code and make changes easy again.<br>After all, coding should be fun."

  title: "Testing Web Accessibility is Fun"
  description: "When we develop a new web application, we often put a lot of work on the design, on making it beautiful and usable. In other words, we want our web app to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the user. But a lot of times we donâ€™t think about the user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments.<br>I will show you some testing tools, libraries and techniques to increase the accessibility (<emph>a11y</emph>) test coverage of your code with a simple React application example."

  title: "DevOps Culture"
  description: "In order to better support the business and meet the demands of the customers, developers need to often build and release new features. Often, once a feature is released into production, the developers have to move to the next feature and forget all about the released one. For the customer, the story doesn't end here - the feature must be available, correct and reliable. This is the domain of IT-Operations, the teams that need to make sure production is up and running. While developers focus on speed and releasing new features, operations focus on stability and keeping features working.<br>This is clearly a problem if teams optimize for their local goals. In this talk, we will attempt to explain the culture shift required to bring together the dev and ops teams, optimizing for the goals of the company as a whole."

  title: "Google Cloud Spanner"
  description: "There is a great number of reasons why RDBMS systems are still very popular. For devel-opers it is very convenient to rely on ACID properties of the persistence layers. All entities involved in a transaction are either committed at once or rolled back. At any point in time, client have a consistent view on queried data. Furthermore, there is a broad understanding of relational data modelling and how to query the data with SQL.<br>This is where the project Spanner was born at Google in 2012. It can be described as a globally scalable, relational database system that supports transactional consistency. Today Spanner underpins Gmail, AdWords, Google Photos, the Play Store and 2000 more of Google services. It has been made publicly available as managed cloud database `Cloud Spanner` in 2017 using the marketing term 'NewSQL'."

  title: "Build your own Knowledge Graph with Weaviate on GCP"
  description: "Maybe you've heard of them before, knowledge graphs. But if you haven't, no worries, you are not alone. Knowledge graphs take an entirely new approach to data management. What makes them stand out from other data solutions is that they focus on the meaning and context of data by extracting the purpose of the language.<br>The use cases are almost endless. It allows scientists to automate drug discovery, doctors to search for diseases based on patients' symptoms, to map our complex Internet of Things landscapes, gather insights from billions of financial transactions, and many more things."

  title: "How to cook with RxJS"
  description: "The trickiest part of learning reactive development is switching your mindset to <emph>think reactively</emph>. With so many operators out there learning Rx on your own is often overwhelming. And no, marbles don't help. But we are living in a reactive world and we can find examples everywhere around us.<br>Join me in unwrapping the ReactiveX down to the basic ingredients and apply this mindset to code a game. After all, in a reactive world, writing code is no more than telling a story."

  title: "Actions on Google: personalize for each user and device"
  description: "What sets apart a good action is personalizing the experience for each user, adapting to their needs and offer the best experience for whichever device the user is currently using. Customizing the responses, storing information and manipulating the medium of the displayed response, can all be achieved by learning how to leverage the AoG SDK. Together we will learn the differences between the DialogFlow SDK and the AoG SDK, how to perform all the above and some best practices that will help you build your action faster and better. The language we're going to use during this talk is Kotlin."

  title: "Secure Credential Management with Vault in Kubernetes"
  description: "Kubernetes is growing day by day - and even though it has generally a good focus on security, it's default credential management with secrets can not be called safe nor easy.<br>Hashicorps Vault supports Kubernetes and improves the 'safety' part - but the management gets even more difficult. Fortunately Kubernetes has webhooks, and with the correct set-up, which you can get from an open-source project of banzaicloud, you can make the vault configuration nearly disappear.<br>We will see how you can get it up and running, what's going on behind the curtains and why the vault is a really safe alternative to secrets."
