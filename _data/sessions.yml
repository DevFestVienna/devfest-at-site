  title: "Zookeeper"
  description: "Leader election and automatic fail over are two common tasks in every distributed environment. There are various reasons why multiple instances of the same software are running at the same time, for example because of load balancing, hot standby or dedicated instances for different tasks (same software but other configuration, etc.). Depending on your architecture, different aspects of these are more important than others. Furthermore, it is easier to develop services that have one master and one or more slaves than developing service set-ups in which every service is equal. This talk will show a quick example of how to achieve this goal using Zookeeper."

  title: "Hybrid Appokalypsis"
  description: "In 2012 Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that their biggest mistake was to bet too much on HTML5 for their mobile apps. Four years later hybrid mobile apps that present the user with an HTML based UI in a native wrapper still have a bad reputation. However, hybrid apps have spent that time sneaking their way onto our desktops. Atom, Spotify and Slack all use web technologies to power some or all of their desktop applications. In this talk, we will focus on hybrid desktop development with Electron looking at the differences between mobile and desktop development and finding out how to get started building our own cross platform desktop applications."

  description: "Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) delivers outstanding page-load performance for users browsing content on the mobile web, which is hugely important on limited or flaky networks. Progressive Web Apps (PWA) deliver reliable performance for re-visits to sites thanks to Service Workers and allows unprecedented engagement via push notifications and the App Shell architecture.<br>AMP gets content in front of users fast - PWAs enable rich experiences and engagement. What if I told you there’s a way to utilize the unique power of both? To build a web experience that loads in an instant and upgrades you to maximum interactivity and engagement? We’re making it happen. Come to learn how."

  title: "Introduction to GraphQL"
  description: "Is there a better way for client apps to define what is the data they need? Modern apps often fail short when backed by a REST api – fetching data is unintuitive, inefficient and cumbersome. GraphQL challenges the status quo with some interesting features, we'll look at how it compares to a classic RESTful api and what are the real benefits it brings to the table."

  description: "At its inception the internet was intended to provide an open platform for information sharing.<br>1.0) Everyone was welcome to run up their own web server and share their ideas and creations without without restriction. <br>2.0) What actually happened is that a small number of organisations took control of people's data and held it in silos tightly restricting content and access. <br>3.0) Using decentralised protocols we can release the grip of the 'central hub' and start working on a future that brings us closer to how the web was originally intended."
