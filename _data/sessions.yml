  title: "Architecting for performance. A top-down approach"
  description: "Focused on a top-down approach, it covers the main layers where a software architect or performance engineer must be involved by revealing performance design principles, tactics, patterns, algorithms, strategies, operating system and hardware level optimizations. Each of these layers are detailed by offering suggestions and examples (including some performance tests) for the audience regarding what it really matters and what should be avoided when designing for performance. Main topics: - design principles (e.g. cohesion, polymorphism / abstractizations, cyclomatic complexity, algorithms complexity, etc) - tactics, patterns, algorithms, strategies (e.g. caching, batching, design asynchronous, non-blocking, memory access patterns, lock free algorithms, data structures, etc) - operating system (e.g. large pages, NUMA, thread affinity, RamFS/TmpFS, IO Scheduler, etc) - hardware (e.g. false sharing, C-states, Zero Bit Recording, Solid State Drive, CPU stalls, Cache misses, etc)"

  description: "Firebase offers two cloud-based, client-accessible database solutions that support realtime data syncing. In this talk, we’ll cover Could Firestore, Firebase's new database solution. It’s an efficient, low-latency database solution for mobile apps that is optimized for speed, security, and offline use. Cloud Firestore lets you build rich, high quality applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Besides being easy to use, it allows you to use queries to decrease the data usage and increase the security so that you can get just the info you need for your user. When offline, apps remain responsive because the Firebase SDK persists your data to disk, giving the end user an immersive experience. Come and learn how you can use Cloud Firestore to effortlessly build powerful realtime experiences on Android in a faster and more efficient way to bring your products to millions of users without worrying about scaling."
