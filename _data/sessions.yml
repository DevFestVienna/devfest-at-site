  title: "Zookeeper"
  description: "Leader election and automatic fail over are two common tasks in every distributed environment. There are various reasons why multiple instances of the same software are running at the same time, for example because of load balancing, hot standby or dedicated instances for different tasks (same software but other configuration, etc.). Depending on your architecture, different aspects of these are more important than others. Furthermore, it is easier to develop services that have one master and one or more slaves than developing service set-ups in which every service is equal. This talk will show a quick example of how to achieve this goal using Zookeeper."

  title: "Hybrid Appokalypsis"
  description: "In 2012 Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that their biggest mistake was to bet too much on HTML5 for their mobile apps. Four years later hybrid mobile apps that present the user with an HTML based UI in a native wrapper still have a bad reputation. However, hybrid apps have spent that time sneaking their way onto our desktops. Atom, Spotify and Slack all use web technologies to power some or all of their desktop applications. In this talk, we will focus on hybrid desktop development with Electron looking at the differences between mobile and desktop development and finding out how to get started building our own cross platform desktop applications."

  title: "How to generate a REST application in 5 minutes"
  description: "This talk will show how you can use Swagger-Codegen to generate a complete web application and deploy to application servers. Examples: * CXF 3 * Spring-WebMVC * Resteasy First I'll demo how to generate the applications & how they work in the container (Tomcat + Jboss EAP). The talk will continue how this works in Swagger-Codegen and how additional features can be added to the generator (e.g. adding Gzip-support, enhancing test cases, add additional configuration files, etc.). Additionally, I can show how a client SDK can be generated & used for e.g. Javascript (I added the Javascript generator for Swagger-Codegen in Dec. 2015)."
