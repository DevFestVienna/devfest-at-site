  title: "Honey Wi-Fi Traffic: A case study on Wi-Fi security"
  description: "The talk will be a short introduction to an ongoing research project that is trying to assess security risks of public and unencrypted Wi-Fi hotspots. For the study, an Android app is automatically connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots, testing limitations (e.g. blocked ports), and collecting information about the hotspot. Furthermore, the app is sending “honey traffic” that includes sensitive data like login credentials for different services, that could be eavesdropped and abused by attackers. By controlling the server that offers those services, we are able to detect if data has been intercepted."

  title: "The road to pure Kotlin"
  description: "Kotlin is the hot new thing in the Android world. After Google endorsed it as the second official programming language for Android, it is high time for companies to start gathering Kotlin experience. However, adapting a new technology is always a daunting task, especially if you have a large existing code-base. By sharing the experience of gradually migrating the willhaben Android app to 100% Kotlin code, I want to show you that a migration might not be as difficult as you think, and what you can gain by investing the resources."

  description: "There are many platforms to create your product, however there is still just one set of laws you must comply with. With different methods of presentation of your product, there sometimes comes a challenge when trying to comply with every legal requirement there is - especially personal data. From May 25th, 2018, there is a complete overhaul of personal data processing and collection (GDPR). Don't miss out on responsibilities you have to cover to avoid any legal action against you and your product."

  title: "Why should Spanner excite you?"
  description: "The CAP theorem proved it mathematically that you can’t build a distributed database that is both consistent and highly available. In spite of this, Google’s Cloud Spanner promises a consistent infinitely scalable distributed database combining the advantages of the SQL and NoSQL world. How is this technologically possible? And how does it work in practice? At Doctusoft, we face challenges every day that could be solved by Spanner. Our multi TB cloud application called AODocs is presented as a case study, to show the problems caused by using a NoSQL database and how Spanner could resolve them."

  title: "How to build a personalized feed for willhaben apps which delivers in under 200ms"
  description: "We implemented a feed component which serves as the central background component for our newly designed apps. The feed receives data from multiple different sources and components. The data needs to be postprocessed and some of it also requires interaction between the components to correlate it correctly. We have to make sure that each component is handled in a performant and secure way, while ensuring that the feed also works if one or multiple components fail. Therefore we used Gatling to performance test the components to guarantee that that it delivers its data in a specific amount of time. Hystrix was used to handle component failures and downtimes. That process involved many parties in our company."

  title: "ANDROID ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS: Dawn of a new era in Android development"
  description: "In the last I/O, Google’s Android framework team introduced the android.arch library. For the first time, Google is giving developers a head-start on which principles to follow when developing Android applications. This library solves practically the most persisting problem in Android development. Other than that, it reduces boiler-plate. This library promotes the MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern and it pushes android applications down the functional/reactivity road. The MVVM principle eases unit testing and makes Android applications modular. It ensures there is little or no room for resource leaks."
