  title: "(kick-ass) Documentation Driven Development"
  description: "We often only start writing documentation for our apps and app functionality after we have developed them. Instead, when you start with writing down the requirements (BDD), intended usage and example use cases, documentation writing not only moves away from being a painful last-minute kind of thing, but actually becomes a vital part in the decision making process - making sure we don't feature-freak and built unnecessary stuff. Which translates to smarter software development, less killing darlings and more time for the important stuff in life: coding ALL the rubies (yes, I am one of those people)."

  title: "Death to Passwords"
  description: "User authentication in mobile applications is a very common and integral use case. Implementing regular passwords is an easy solution for developers but comes with several pitfalls that impair user experience like (re-)entering passwords, the need to create a new unique password or even just the input of personal data on a flaky keyboard while registering a new account.<br><br>In this talk the security flaws and UX implications of passwords will be discussed and highlighted which different techniques exist that are able to offer a more mobile friendly flow. Highlighting authorization and authentication techniques like OAuth, OpenID Connect and even hardware features like Bluetooth Low Energy this talk will be interesting for anyone who's facing a situation where creating and storing user accounts matters."

  title: "Java Image Processing Survival Guide"
  description: "If you are ever asked to convert, process and scale millions of real-world images using Java it will be a painful experience - at least it was for me. I came across unexpected problems ranging from CMYK, alpha-channel handling, multi-page TIFF, image compression algorithms, setting DPIs, PDF preview generation, decompression bombs to efficient image scaling. At hindsight I wished there was some single resource of information to guide me through my problems - and this is exactly the reason for this presentation. It provides real-life experience in replacing an ImageMagick/JMagick image conversion & scaling with a pure Java implementation covering Apache PDFBox, Java Advanced Imaging API (JAI), TwelveMonkeys ImageIO plugins, Sanselan (aks Commons Imaging) and different Java-based image-scaling libraries."

  title: "Keeping your secrets secret in an Open Source world"
  description: "While open source is great there are some things you can't publish together with your source, like client secrets or database access passwords. In this talk I will discuss this problem and present several solutions, with a focus on the Google Cloud Platform."
