I will guide you through the process of creating the page objects interfaces, building the test cases from them, implementing the page objects itself and debug / maintain after changes in the AUT.<br/>At the end you should be able to write functional tests for your Web-Application in no time and be sure it stays maintainable and fast when you add features to your application and scale up the test coverage. With stuff like parallel execution and nightly runs up and running, I can say mission accomplished and one more well tested application with less bugs will help in getting the bugpains out of the users."

Hybrid apps are a bit of mix between a native app and an html5-based app (Web App). There are different frameworks for hybrid app development and Phonegap is one of the best alternative in this domain. Phonegap is a cross platform based framework that helps to compile a web application into a native app for different mobile OS (not only android). Phonegap is a kind of 'Code once, and run everywhere'. We will see the different aspect of this framework and some advantages as well as the downsides."

Next we will cover the pros and cons of Polyglot persistence. Then we will see how to build location aware Job search application using MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Solr. The different data storage solutions are used to persist different types of data like MongoDB to store Job data along with its location, PostgreSQL to store User data, Redis as a cache for User objects and other goodies, and Solr as a full text search engine. Finally, the application will be deployed to OpenShift -- open source Platform as a Service."

Some tests are simply a burden.<br/>During the talk I plan to present many examples of imperfect tests and show how to improve them. I will discuss typical issues related to writing tests and present techniques which can save our code like parametrized tests, custom asserts, test data builders. The talk is technical, full of useful hints & tips & tricks & dos and & dont's. It also presents few tools (that are not so commonly used). All code examples discussed during the talk are taken from real code."
