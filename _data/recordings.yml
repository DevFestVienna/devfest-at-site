  title: "PageObject Pattern - Selenium Codelab"
  description: "You will be given a demo AUT (Application under Test) and some requirements with corresponding test cases as well as a skeleton project to get you started with Selenium.<br/>Your mission will be to have all the test cases automated without writing any duplicate code and future proof in sense of maintainability. I will guide you through the process of creating the page objects interfaces, building the test cases from them, implementing the page objects itself and debug / maintain after changes in the AUT.<br/>At the end you should be able to write functional tests for your Web-Application in no time and be sure it stays maintainable and fast when you add features to your application and scale up the test coverage. With stuff like parallel execution and nightly runs up and running, I can say mission accomplished and one more well tested application with less bugs will help in getting the bugpains out of the users."
