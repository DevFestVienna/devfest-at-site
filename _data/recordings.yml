  description: "5 years ago the EU Commision and corporates kick-started a project aiming to create FIWare (Future Internet ware), a technology that enables cost-efficient development of digital solutions. FIWare is an open-source cloud platform with public and royalty-free APIs for different verticals, such as Media, Agrifood, Energy etc. To mention few, there are APIs that make audiovisual content accessible like text and 3D maps ready for your applications. FIWare is running on 17 maintained data centers that are located across Europe. Open data are available so that developers can quickly create prototypes. EU has dedicated funds for ideas that are executed using FIWare, as well as for building up commercial nodes. I am looking forward to introduce you to possibilities related to Future Internet."

  description: "For a long time I thought that working on a green field project was the best thing that could happen to a developer. I would look at the nightmarish company code base blaming the incompetence of the people who came before me. If only they read more books or had better mentors - I would say, but I was wrong. It's time for us to face the ugly truth about legacy code, and learn why and how to embrace it."

  title: "Microservice - no fluff the REAL stuff"
  description: "Some developers tend to believe that big data and huge traffics are pre-requisites to harness and reap the benefits offered by microservices. However, there are many problems like polyglot persistence, faster continuous build cycle, shorter release plan, etc. that can be solved by applying microservice architecture even in smaller organizations. You don't have to be a software giant to leverage stability, effectiveness and flexibility provided by microservices. Microservice architecture has a lot to offer even for smaller organizations. In this talk, we will walk through the key concepts like service discovery & registry, circuit breaker, API gateway and edge service. Build a bunch of microservices demonstrating practical implementation of these patterns using open source components like Eureka, Zuul, Hystrix and powered by spring cloud. Lastly, we will deploy our microservices on a container based solution, i.e. Docker and demonstrate how to use docker-compose for defining and running micro services."

  title: "How to measure and improve Android code quality"
  description: "Android projects get bigger and more complex constantly, thus they tend to acquire a lot of technical debt and clutter. To resist this, we need to be aware of changes in project quality in first place. Many Android developers already use a continuous integration server to build, test and distribute their apps. But how can you automatically measure development quality? A variety of tools is available that measure different aspects of a project. In this talk I will present the most useful tools and show how to automate them with a Jenkins build server. These include tools measuring code style violations, analyzing static code for possible bugs, code coverage tools to estimate testing efforts, but also ones that find memory leaks, or verify the up-to-dateness of libraries used. I will demonstrate which tools of this selection can be combined into a dashboard to give developers a glance able project health overview. In conclusion, I will provide insights, how useful these tools are and how a team improves its coding habits with them instead of just gaming the metrics."

  description: "In the talk we will present various applied techniques for sandboxing and isolation. Starting with description of ways for isolation in selected programming languages, we will proceed to describe the concepts used in various implementations of a fully-fledged sandbox at application level (design philosophy, limitations). Using the presented information to outline expectations for a sandbox solution, we will progress to detail chosen features of modern operating systems applicable and already used for sandbox implementation at OS level. We will take a look how these features are integrated into existing sandboxing solutions. Finally at the end we will see how the concept of sandbox can be used to implement OS independent software / application development platforms, what approaches are used there, discuss selected working prototypes of this effort, and sketch where the development in this area might be heading in the future."

Hybrid apps are a bit of mix between a native app and an html5-based app (Web App). There are different frameworks for hybrid app development and Phonegap is one of the best alternative in this domain. Phonegap is a cross platform based framework that helps to compile a web application into a native app for different mobile OS (not only android). Phonegap is a kind of 'Code once, and run everywhere'. We will see the different aspect of this framework and some advantages as well as the downsides."

  description: "Based on a flying shark, a Vaadin UI, a beagle bone black, an Arduino board, Apache Message Queue, Koneki, Lua and the MQTT protocol we are demonstrating how simple it is to remote control an airswimmer (www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOPImRA2AlI). Sharky may also swim complex maneuvers itself controlled by a beagle bone. All circuit diagrams, programs, applications are available for download on github."

  title: "Bad Tests, Good Tests"
  description: "Writing tests looks simple - every kid could write few lines of JUnit code. :) Writing valuable tests is much more challenging. Everyone has seen (or has written themself!) tests, which are hard to understand, hard to maintain, and do not verify anything really important (or maybe they do, but it is too hard to deduce)! Some tests are simply a burden.<br/>During the talk I plan to present many examples of imperfect tests and show how to improve them. I will discuss typical issues related to writing tests and present techniques which can save our code like parametrized tests, custom asserts, test data builders. The talk is technical, full of useful hints & tips & tricks & dos and & dont's. It also presents few tools (that are not so commonly used). All code examples discussed during the talk are taken from real code."

  title: "(Kick-ass) Documentation Driven Development"
  description: "We often only start writing documentation for our apps and app functionality after we have developed them. Instead, when you start with writing down the requirements (BDD), intended usage and example use cases, documentation writing not only moves away from being a painful last-minute kind of thing, but actually becomes a vital part in the decision making process - making sure we don't feature-freak and built unnecessary stuff. Which translates to smarter software development, less killing darlings and more time for the important stuff in life: coding ALL the rubies (yes, I am one of those people)."

  description: "Sentiment analysis is a new trend when it comes to data-mining, in its ability to better analyze end user's opinions about different products, via the use of social media. Sentiment analysis have been done with different Data-mining algorithms and techniques. Since Google API also provides the same pattern of development, experimenting such technology with this API can help us got following result:<br>-Given a user's past viewing habits, predict what other movies or products a user might like.<br>- Categorize emails as spam or non-spam.<br>- Analyze posted comments about your product to determine whether they have a positive or negative tone.<br>- Guess how much a user might spend on a given day, given his spending history."

Since the uptime of our software is very important, we try to apply best practices to our development and deployment workflow. Our system is based on different stacks, which includes the use of different languages like PHP, Scala and TypeScript. This talk is about how we manage the consistency of our data-models through the different stacks, how the connection of our services is done through APIs and the deployment strategy of our system to get a nearly zero-downtime continous integration pipeline. I'll also show, how we use code generators and shell scripts to automate code creation and tasks. Last, I'll show how we handle our database migrations."

  title: "Java Image Processing Survival Guide"
  description: "If you are ever asked to convert, process and scale millions of real-world images using Java it will be a painful experience - at least it was for me. I came across unexpected problems ranging from CMYK, alpha-channel handling, multi-page TIFF, image compression algorithms, setting DPIs, PDF preview generation, decompression bombs to efficient image scaling. At hindsight I wished there was some single resource of information to guide me through my problems - and this is exactly the reason for this presentation. It provides real-life experience in replacing an ImageMagick/JMagick image conversion & scaling with a pure Java implementation covering Apache PDFBox, Java Advanced Imaging API (JAI), TwelveMonkeys ImageIO plugins, Sanselan (aks Commons Imaging) and different Java-based image-scaling libraries."
