Harald likes to keep things simple, and will soon get tired  of bad user experiences and overly complex UIs (even though he must confess that he might have helped creating such things in the past, if he is to be completely honest). Over the years, Harald has been an active member of the Norwegian JUG; javaBin. He has given various presentations at local user meetups and participating in the planning and execution,  as well as speaking at the JavaZone conference. In addition to building Lego, bicycling and listening to jazz, Harald is interested in photography and digital image processing. He has developed  a strange affection for obscure file formats. Even though it's getting ever harder to find time to program for fun in his spare time, every once in a while he gets to use these skills for something useful, and write beautiful code. That makes him happy. :-)"

My major task now is technical project leadership for Smart TV development, being hobbyist game developer at the same time. I am interested in computers since the late 80’s, when I was one of the few lucky users of the Commodore 64 machine behind the iron curtain. I started programming at that time and since then software development has become my passion. I progressed from coding on C64 and assembler in MS-DOS up to the current development of software for the most recent smartphone and TV platforms. I started mobile development in 2003 on the Symbian platform, when Nokia released the first smartphone 7650 followed by the famous Siemens SX1. As a Symbian developer, I participated and won several developers competitions and was the only one developer named a Forum Nokia Champion 6 times in a row (I simply loved the C++ and Symbian ;).<br/>I spend my free time with my son and I love travelling in former Soviet countries."
