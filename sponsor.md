DevFest Vienna is now in its fourth year, participant numbers are increasing (last year we had over 250 attendees), and we get an ever increasing social media coverage.

We have sponsorship packages starting from 500 EUR in the categories **Bronze**, **Silver** and **Gold**.
Depending on the package your company is featured on the website, in social media mentions (grouped or also individual), it can be present with a table at the conference, and it can display a rollup at the foyer.

Above this we offer an exclusive **Platinum** package (maximum two sponsors) who will be featured throughout the conference.

Sponsors can also opt to sponsor specifically a room, a break (breakfast / coffee / lunch), the hackathon or the afterparty (_powered by_).

_Interested in being part of the event as a sponsor? Excellent! [Let us know about it!](mailto:team@devfest.at)_
