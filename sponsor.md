DevFest Vienna is now in its seventh year, participant numbers are increasing (last year we had over 250 attendees), and we get an ever increasing social media coverage.

We have sponsorship packages starting from 500 EUR in the categories **Bronze**, **Silver** and **Gold**.
Depending on the package your company is featured on the website, in social media mentions (grouped or also individual), you can be present with a table at the conference, and also display a rollup at the foyer.

We are currently working on the new sponsorship packages and you will find a link here soon.

Download our [sponsorship brochure](/pdf/DevFest_Vienna_Sponsorship.pdf) for a detailed description of the packages and your benefits.

In addition we offer an exclusive **Platinum** package (there can only be one) who will be featured throughout the conference.

Sponsors can also opt to sponsor specifically a room, a break (breakfast / coffee / lunch), the hackathon or the afterparty ("Coffee break _powered by_ ...").
