DevFest Vienna is now in its fourth year, participant numbers are increasing (last year we had over 250 attendees), and we get an ever increasing social media coverage.

_Interested in being part of the event as a sponsor? Excellent! [Let us know about it!](mailto:team@devfest.at)_

### Silver - 500 EUR ###
As a silver sponsor, your logo is present on the local web site as well as in social media mentions (Google+ and Twitter). 
You can provide stickers and / or flyers for the participants.

### Gold - 1000 EUR ###
As gold sponsor, you get the same coverage as a silver sponsor, so your logo is present on the local web site as well as in social media mentions (Google+ and Twitter).
In addition, you will get mentioned on the web sites of the host organizations (JSUG and GDG Vienna).

In addition to providing stickers and flyers to participants, you can attend the event with your own table, mount a poster at the location and present your products or company in a short pitch. One attendee from your company is allowed to represent you on-site.

### Platinum - 1500 EUR ###
As platinum sponsor, you get the most comprehensive presence online and at the event. Your logo (bigger size) is present on the local web site, you are getting mentions in social media interactions (Google+, Facebook and Twitter), you are mentioned on the web sites of the host organizations (JSUG and GDG Vienna), and your logo will be present on their websites for a full year.

Just the same, your presence at the location is at platinum level as well. Stickers, flyers, poster and a table are part of the package. Two attendees from your company are allowed to represent you on-site.
