Interested in being part of the event as a speaker?

_We encourage submissions from female speakers to enhance the gender balance._

**Call for Speakers is open till 30 April!**

####Type of Sessions####
A regular talk (e.g. presentation, tech talk, etc) is supposed
to take about 45 minutes with some minutes afterwards for
questions and answers.

In addition, there is the opportunity for _highlight presentations_
of shorter duration (20 minutes and some minutes for questions & answers).
They are ideal for presenting an idea or a toolset without going
too much into technical details.

####Language of the Sessions####
All sessions will be held in English.

####Equipment####
Each room is equiped with a beamer and network connectivity for your
notebook PC.
We also have adapters for MacBook / MacBook Air (MiniDP).

####Participant Requirements####
Let us know what requirements participants should satisfy to fully
make use of your talk or presentation.

General coding knowledge and developing experience can be assumed.
Special language knowledge, experience with specific APIs or
frameworks should however be announced in advance.
