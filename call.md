#### Topics ####

As always DevFest Vienna is about new trends in software development for mobile, cloud, social and web.
You are encouraged to submit talks about upcoming and trending topics which will be relevant in the future.

#### Type of Sessions ####

A regular talk (e.g. presentation, tech talk, etc) is supposed
to take about 45 minutes with some minutes afterwards for
questions and answers.

In addition, there is the opportunity for _highlight presentations_
of shorter duration (20 minutes and some minutes for questions & answers).
They are ideal for presenting an idea or a toolset without going
too much into technical details.

notebook PC.
We also have adapters for MacBook / MacBook Air (MiniDP).

frameworks should however be announced in advance.

#### FAQ ####

Generally we won't be able to cover travel expenses.
We have a limited budget to subsidize costs for community speakers.
