<h4 id="type-of-sessions">Type of Sessions</h4>
<p>
A regular talk (e.g. presentation, tech talk, etc) is supposed
to take about 45 minutes with some minutes afterwards for
questions and answers.
</p>
<p>
In addition, there is the opportunity for _highlight presentations_
of shorter duration (20 minutes and some minutes for questions & answers).
They are ideal for presenting an idea or a toolset without going
too much into technical details.

All sessions will be held in English.
</p>

make use of your talk or presentation.
