DevFest Vienna is dedicated to being open to everyone and making the conference a safe place for all. We do not discriminate based on ethnic background, religion, gender, sexuality, body shape, or disability. We do not tolerate harassment based on discrimination.

We insist that all participants and attendees adhere to a civil demeanor at all times. This includes refraining from inappropriate language, comments and behaviour. This includes, but is not limited to: sexually oriented language and images, unwanted attention, threatening behaviour, physical assault, theft.

_Participants, sponsors, speakers or attendees who are being harassed, intimidated, or are dealing with otherwise improper behaviour are encouraged to report it immediately to an official DevFest organizer team member. Organizer team members are identified by the red highlighted badges._

Alternate methods of reporting issues include:

* email [team@devfest.at](mailto:team@devfest.at)
* call the Vienna police department at 112

Anyone who is found to be in violation of this policy may be handled in any one or more of these methods, depending on the offense:

* warning
* expulsion (see below)
* contacting of the police

Actions stronger than a warning will be taken at the discretion of two or more members of the DevFest organizer team.

False reports will be treated harshly. Personal disputes should be handled privately, unless actual harassment occurs.

_DevFest Vienna reserves the right to remove any participant, sponsor or attendee at any time for any reason._

This policy covers all organized events for the DevFest Vienna, including social events.
